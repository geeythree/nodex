# MVP: Smart Domain-Aware Workflow Generator

## 🎯 Vision
Transform basic workflow descriptions into **production-ready, domain-intelligent automations** that include professional best practices, missing steps, and stakeholder considerations automatically.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Current State
- Domain Detection ✅ (via `domain_identifier.py`)
- Basic CrewAI Agent Pipeline ✅
- JSON Workflow Generation ✅

### Enhancement Strategy
```
User Input → Domain Detection → Enhanced Agent Chain → Professional Workflow
                    ↓
            Domain Intelligence Injection
                    ↓
        Missing Step Detection & Addition
                    ↓
        Professional Polish & Templates
```

## 🚀 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Smart Agent Enhancement (Priority 1)
**Goal**: Inject domain intelligence into existing agents without architectural changes

**Changes to Make**:
1. **Enhanced Agent Prompts** - Add domain-specific intelligence
2. **New Enhancement Agent** - Review and suggest missing professional steps
3. **Smart Node Types** - Better labels, descriptions, and contexts

**Files to Modify**:
- `agentcrews/mediator/hackathon_backend.py` - Agent task definitions
- `agentcrews/mediator/vertical_agents.py` - If using vertical agents
- `agentcrews/mediator/crew_factory.py` - Agent creation logic

### Phase 2: Node Intelligence (Priority 2)  
**Goal**: Generate professional-quality nodes with proper labeling and context

**Features**:
- Smart icon mapping based on node purpose
- Professional descriptions explaining why each step exists
- Stakeholder annotations (who interacts with each node)
- Industry-appropriate terminology

### Phase 3: Template Overlay (Priority 3)
**Goal**: Add pattern recognition and professional workflow templates

**Features**:
- Common workflow pattern detection
- Automatic operational node injection (monitoring, alerts)
- Best practice overlays per domain

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Agent Prompts

**Current Interpreter Agent**:
```python
"Convert user requirements into specific, executable automation steps"
```

**Enhanced Interpreter Agent**:
```python
"""
Convert user requirements into specific, executable automation steps with domain intelligence:

HEALTHCARE CONTEXT: Include patient consent workflows, HIPAA compliance checks, clinical validation steps, provider notifications, audit trails, and patient communication.

BANKING/FINANCE CONTEXT: Include KYC verification, fraud detection, regulatory reporting, multi-stage approvals, compliance monitoring, and customer communication.

HOBBYIST/CREATOR CONTEXT: Include error handling, user feedback systems, analytics tracking, content moderation, and performance optimization.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES: Always consider data validation, error handling, stakeholder notifications, audit trails, and user experience.
"""
```

### 2. New Enhancement Agent

**Purpose**: Review generated workflows and add commonly forgotten professional steps

**Enhanced Agent Definition**:
```python
def create_enhancement_agent(domain: str):
    return Agent(
        role="Workflow Enhancement Specialist",
        goal=f"Review and enhance workflows with professional best practices for {domain} domain",
        backstory=f"""You are a senior consultant who has implemented hundreds of {domain} workflows. 
        You spot missing steps that junior developers forget: error handling, stakeholder notifications, 
        compliance requirements, monitoring, and operational concerns. You ensure workflows are 
        production-ready and include all necessary professional touches.""",
        verbose=True,
        llm=os.getenv("CREWAI_MODEL", "gpt-4o")
    )
```

**Enhancement Task**:
```python
enhancement_task = Task(
    description=f"""
    Review the workflow and add missing professional components:
    
    OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
    - Error handling and retry logic for each step
    - Monitoring and alerting for failures
    - Logging and audit trails
    - Data validation and sanitization
    
    STAKEHOLDER REQUIREMENTS:
    - User notification systems
    - Approval workflows where appropriate
    - Status updates and dashboards
    - Feedback and communication loops
    
    DOMAIN-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS ({domain.upper()}):
    - Compliance and regulatory nodes (locked, cannot be removed)
    - Industry best practices and standards
    - Professional terminology and descriptions
    - Integration with common domain tools
    
    Output additional nodes and enhancements to the existing workflow.
    """,
    agent=enhancement_agent,
    expected_output="List of additional nodes and enhancements with justifications"
)
```

### 3. Smart Node Enhancement

**Node Intelligence Rules**:
```python
def enhance_node_intelligence(node, domain):
    """Add professional intelligence to nodes"""
    
    # Smart icon mapping
    icon_map = {
        'webhook': '🔗', 'http': '🌐', 'database': '💾', 
        'email': '📧', 'validation': '✅', 'approval': '👥',
        'notification': '🔔', 'security': '🔐', 'analytics': '📊'
    }
    
    # Professional descriptions
    if domain == "healthcare":
        description_templates = {
            'validation': 'Ensures patient data integrity and HIPAA compliance',
            'notification': 'HIPAA-compliant patient and provider communication',
            'audit': 'Required audit trail for regulatory compliance'
        }
    elif domain == "finance":
        description_templates = {
            'validation': 'KYC and AML compliance verification',
            'notification': 'Regulatory-compliant customer communication',
            'audit': 'Required audit trail for financial regulations'
        }
    # ... etc
    
    # Stakeholder annotations
    stakeholder_map = {
        'healthcare': {'patient': '👤', 'provider': '👨‍⚕️', 'admin': '👩‍💼'},
        'finance': {'customer': '👤', 'advisor': '👨‍💼', 'compliance': '🛡️'}
    }
    
    return enhanced_node
```
